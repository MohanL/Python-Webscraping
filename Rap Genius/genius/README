This project is me being introduced to webcrawling and scraping with Scrapy and Selenium.

First, Selenium initializes the browser. Then, Scrapy collects the artist information. Selenium moves to the next page and Scrapy collects the data. This repeats until all the data is collected.

The script then analyzes the data and outputs the highest contributing artists.
