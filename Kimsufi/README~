kimsufi_status.py	Script

Kimsufi status utilizes the JSON and Requests libraries to scrape the Kimsufi website. SMTPlib is used to send the email, notifying you of the server's availbility.

Selenium is used to automate the payment process. I did not fully automate the process, but in theory one could.

On an OSX system, one can create a workfow app to check for avalible servers periodically in the background and eliminate the need to manually start the script on startup.
